= Ruby Learning Tests

Ruby Unit tests written to learn ruby and their most specific details, 
differences between versions and other curiosities

Includes version conditional code currently between version 1.8.x and 1.9.x

== Usage

To run all the tests together use:
  rake
or
  rake test
or
  rake test:digest

To run all tests separately use:
  rake test:all

To run individual tests use:
  rake test:<name>
replacing <name> by the name of the test

To see which tests you can run use:

  rake -T
  
== Write Your Own Tests
If you write your own tests and need to create more files follow the
pattern already in place 'test_*.rb' replacing * by the name of the test.
This way the Rakefile will create new tasks automatically for them, or
you can alter the Rakefile if you want.
